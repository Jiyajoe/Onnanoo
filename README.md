## 🚀 The Core Project Idea & Dual Modes

**ONNAANO?** provides two completely distinct computer vision workflows:

### ✂️ Mode 1: Split One Object
1. **Dual Input Methods**: Choose between **Upload Photo** (drag-and-drop, image preview, replace, remove) OR **Open Camera** (live browser webcam stream, viewfinder, instant shutter capture, retake).
2. **AI Posture & Orientation Normalization**:
   - Isolates the foreground object from background noise.
   - Uses Principal Component Analysis (PCA) & bounding geometry to estimate the exact tilt angle.
   - Normalizes and rotates the object to canonical upright alignment with a **Before $\rightarrow$ After** visual comparison.
3. **Object Identification**:
   - Evaluates geometric & visual archetypes (*Pencil*, *Bottle*, *Spoon*, *Ruler*, *Smartphone*, *Cup*, *Book*, *Scissors*, etc.) and reports confidence scores.
4. **Physical Property Extraction**:
   - **Shape**: Circularity ($4\pi A/P^2$), aspect ratio, solidity, rectangularity, bilateral symmetry score.
   - **Dimensions**: Pixel height, pixel width, bounding box, relative area (clearly labeled as `px (Relative / Image-based)` without fake physical units).
   - **Color**: Dominant color name, hex swatch, and top-5 palette distribution bar via K-Means.
   - **Texture**: Surface roughness score, Laplacian variance, gradient magnitude, Shannon entropy.
5. **$N$-Way Geometric Equal Division**:
   - Slices the object strictly along its normalized principal axis into $N$ equal geometric parts (user-selectable 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, etc.).
   - Visualizes colored part segments, cut lines, and section dimensions.

---

### ⚖️ Mode 2: Divide & Compare Multiple Objects
1. **Dynamic Object Count Selector**:
   - Compare 2, 3, 4, ... up to 8 objects dynamically.
   - Renders independent cards for each object, each supporting Upload or Camera independently.
2. **Auto-Enabled Workflow**:
   - As soon as all $N$ photos are ready, the *"⚡ Compare Objects Now"* button automatically enables (zero confirmation popups).
3. **Pairwise Computer Vision Feature Matching (No Fake Percentages)**:
   - **Shape Similarity**: Hu moments (`cv2.matchShapes`), circularity, and aspect ratio.
   - **Dimension Similarity**: Proportions and bounding aspect ratios.
   - **Color Similarity**: 2D HSV histogram correlation (`cv2.compareHist`) and Euclidean dominant color distance.
   - **Texture Similarity**: Surface roughness, gradient variance, and Shannon entropy.
   - **Feature Similarity**: Real ORB / AKAZE keypoints with Lowe's ratio test ($0.78$) and geometric inliers.
   - **Edge Similarity**: Canny edge map density and contour structure.
   - **Weighted Overall Score**: Explainable combination configured in backend (`config.py`).
4. **Multi-Object Dashboard**:
   - **Object Cards**: Raw tilt thumbnail vs AI upright normalized view, detected class, confidence %, dominant color.
   - **Comparison Table**: Comprehensive feature-by-feature side-by-side data table across all objects.
   - **$N \times N$ Similarity Matrix**: Interactive heatmap grid with color-coded percentages.
   - **Pairwise Feature Breakdown**: Animated progress bars for Shape, Dimensions, Color, Texture, Features, Edges, and Overall.
   - **Relationship Classification**:
     - 👯 **Twin-like** (Very high visual similarity & same category)
     - 👨‍👩‍👧 **Related** (High similarity / same category with subtle differences)
     - 🤝 **Distantly Related** (Moderate similarity or related categories)
     - 👀 **Barely Related** (Low similarity but some shared visual traits)
     - 💀 **Strangers** (Very low similarity / unrelated objects)
   - **Malayalam AI Verdict**: Humorous, culturally authentic Malayalam punchlines with English translations.

The video demonstrates ONNANO? — “Same aano? AI parayatte!”, an AI-powered Computer Vision project. It shows how the system identifies objects from uploaded or captured images, isolates and straightens them, and analyzes their visual properties. The video also demonstrates splitting a single object into equal parts and comparing multiple objects based on their shape, size, colour, texture, and visual features, followed by a similarity score and AI-generated verdict.
